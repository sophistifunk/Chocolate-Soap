This is super-preliminary at the moment, I just wanted to take the time to get it up on Github, mainly as a third backup location. This is *not* working code, so don't bother checking it out. It will be one day though, since I work with a lot of SOAP, and the current (lack of) Cocoa support is killing me. This is where I take out my frustrations after a long slow day at the cube ;-)

If you want to help, or have a WSDL you'd like me to use in my testing, drop me a line at josh@expantra.com
